# Causal inference of real wage gap between immigrants and non-immigrants in the U.S.<br>

<br>
Causal inference of relationship between immigrants’ and non-immigrants’ real wage and other factors utilizing economic theories.<br>
I statistically tested the hypothesis that the real wage between immigrants and non-immigrants are different.<br>
I then explored the data by investigating the correlation between variables and visualization of related data.<br>
Variables and their functional forms are chosen based on economic theories.<br>
After established the regression model, I interpret the results with statistical methods, e.g., p-value and t-value.<br>
The code is written in R. Libraries such as datatable, dplyr, tibble, tiddyverse, and kableExtra are also used in the project.<br>
The language used in the project is R along with library for hypothesis testing, regression analysis including visualizing, cleaning the data and datatable.<br>
The data is from the Current Population Survey (CPS) from 2019.
